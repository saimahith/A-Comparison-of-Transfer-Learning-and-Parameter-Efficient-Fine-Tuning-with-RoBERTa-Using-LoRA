# A-Comparison-of-Transfer-Learning-and-Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning-with-RoBERTa-Using-LoRA

## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive 2 
comparison between traditional transfer 3 
learning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-4 
Tuning (PEFT) techniques on the 5 
RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT 6 
approach) model, leveraging Low-Rank 7 
Adaptation (LoRA). Transfer learning has 8 
been pivotal in natural language processing 9 
(NLP), enabling models to leverage 10 
knowledge from large datasets. However, it 11 
often involves fine-tuning a substantial 12 
number of parameters, leading to 13 
significant computational costs. LoRA, as a 14 
PEFT approach, introduces a novel way to 15 
adapt pre-trained models with a minimal 16 
increase in the number of trainable 17 
parameters. My work evaluates these 18 
methodologies in terms of performance, 19 
efficiency, and practical applicability in 20 
NLP tasks. We demonstrate the 21 
effectiveness of LoRA in achieving 22 
comparable or superior performance to 23 
traditional transfer learning while 24 
significantly reducing the computational 25 
overhead, thus presenting a more resource-26 
efficient alternative for fine-tuning large 27 
language models.

### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
 
Adaptation (LoRA), a Parameter-Efficient Fine-88 
Tuning method. LoRA strategically updates a 89 
small subset of the model's weights, specifically 90 
targeting the rank of the weight matrices in the 91 
Transformer layers. This contrasts with 92 
traditional transfer learning, which involves 93 
updating a larger portion of the model's 94 
weights. LoRA modifies the weight matrices in 95 
the Transformer layers (typically attention and 96 
feed-forward layers) by introducing low-rank 97 
matrices that are trainable while keeping the 98 
original pre-trained weights frozen. The key idea 99 
is to decompose the update of a weight matrix 100 
into two smaller matrices.
